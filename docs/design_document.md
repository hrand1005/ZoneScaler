## Introduction
ZoneScaler is a cutting-edge distributed game server framework designed to scale horizontally and manage dynamic loads across multiple servers. This document outlines the architectural design, features, and considerations for developing the ZoneScaler framework.

## Architectural Overview
ZoneScaler's architecture is based on a coordinator/worker paradigm where the game space is divided into partitions. The system is designed to manage and distribute loads across worker servers dynamically.

### Coordinator Node
The coordinator is the central authority that registers worker servers, defines the game space partitions, and balances the load. It operates on a grid-based partitioning system suitable for both 2D and 3D game spaces.

Responsibilities:
- Monitor the load across partitions.
- Dynamically allocate and redistribute partitions based on load metrics.
- Define and manage proxied entities for cross-partition interactions. 
### Worker Servers
Worker servers are responsible for maintaining the state of their assigned partitions and handling all the game logic within those partitions.

Responsibilities:
- Manage game state independently for scalability.
- Communicate with the coordinator to receive updated partition assignments.
- Handle cross-partition interactions through proxied entities.
## Load Balancing
Load balancing is achieved through the coordinator's continuous monitoring and dynamic redistribution of partitions.

Strategies:
- Estimation of partition load based on the number of players and interactions.
- Redistribution of partitions to ensure an equal distribution of load across servers.
- Potential integration of machine learning algorithms for predictive load balancing.
### Fault Tolerance
ZoneScaler incorporates strategies to ensure continuity of service in the event of worker server failures.

Options:
- **Backup Servers**: Maintain mirrored game state on backup servers ready to take over immediately.
- **Stateless Server Pool**: Keep a pool of warmed-up stateless servers that can quickly adopt the state of a failed server.

## Cross-Partition Interaction
Cross-partition interactions are critical for ensuring seamless gameplay across the boundaries of partitions.

Mechanism:
- Utilize gRPC for efficient and low-latency state synchronization between entities.
- Proxied entities in adjacent partitions to facilitate interaction without going through the coordinator.

## Questions and Considerations
### State Synchronization
- How often should state synchronization occur between adjacent partitions?
- What is the fallback mechanism in case of a synchronization failure?
### Recovery Strategy
- Should the backup server approach use active-active or active-passive replication?
- How can we minimize the downtime during state transfer to a warmed-up server?
### Proxied Entities
- What attributes and state information of entities need to be proxied?
- How will ZoneScaler ensure consistency between the real and proxied entities?
## Possible Approaches
### Scalability
- Implement auto-scaling based on load metrics, potentially integrating with cloud services like Kubernetes for orchestration.
### Consistency Model
- Consider different consistency models (e.g., eventual consistency, strong consistency) for state synchronization based on game requirements.
### Monitoring and Metrics
- Develop a comprehensive monitoring system to track server health, load distribution, and performance metrics.
### Community and Open Source Strategy
- Establish clear guidelines for contributions and set up a governance model for the community-driven development process.
### Conclusion
ZoneScaler aims to be a robust, flexible, and developer-friendly framework for building the next generation of online games. By addressing key challenges such as load balancing, fault tolerance, and cross-partition interactions, ZoneScaler positions itself as a solution for scalable and resilient game server infrastructure. This design document serves as the foundation for development and will evolve as the project progresses, incorporating feedback and discoveries made along the way.
